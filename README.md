# SBSA_VendingMachine
Design and develop a vending machine which vends products based upon four (4) denominations of coins and returns coins if there is no item.


The purpose of this project is to design a vending machine that stores the items you bought in a database and let you know if the item it is sold out or it is still available. It calculates the amount you inserted and gives you change but if you dont have
enough it will also let you know. It refreshes, it clears your options and your exit if you have done purchasing
